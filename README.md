## Endpoints

### Guests

- `GET /guests`: Get all guests.
- `GET /guests/<id>`: Get a specific guest by ID.

### Episodes

- `GET /episodes`: Get all episodes.
- `GET /episodes/<id>`: Get a specific episode by ID.

### Appearances

- `POST /appearances`: Create a new `Appearance` that is associated with an existing `Episode` and `Guest`

#### NOTE

Ensure the body section of postman has a raw json structure as:

```bash
{
  "rating": 5,
  "episode_id": 100,
  "guest_id": 123
}
```

## Setup

- Clone the repository.
- Create environment **(optional)** with `pipenv install`, shell using `pipenv shell` & install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create the database with:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m 'Initial Migration'
flask db upgrade
```

- Run `python seed.py` to seed the database.
- Start the app with `python app.py`.
- Use the URL link together with the API endpoints to run in your postman extension or app.
 For example: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5555/episodes/`
